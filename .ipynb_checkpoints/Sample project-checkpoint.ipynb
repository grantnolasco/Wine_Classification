    "\\[Note: This project is provided as an example of how your project should flow as a document.  Your project, of course, may differ from this in content.  The main purpose of this example is to illustrate how to integrate your code and text to form something that reads more or less like a lab report or research paper.  When reading through it with that in mind, note the following good things about the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is an introduction section that explains what the project is and gives an overview of the data (including a link to the source!).\n",
    "* Decisions about how to write the code are explained, not in excruciating detail, but enough.  There are some comments in the code, but longer discussion is put into markdown cells that preview or review the code.\n",
    "* If the code required trying a few different things to get it to work, it doesn't include all the wrong tries, but briefly describes the troubleshooting process to explain how the eventual code was arrived at.\n",
    "    * (If your project involves a more substantial attempt to compare different methods or ideas, of course you should show the different methods or ideas.  For instance, if you wanted to explore how different scikit models performed on the same task, you should show all the models and compare them.  Don't just show the best one and say \"By the way I tried a bunch of other ones but they weren't as good.\"  In other words, there is a difference between \"wrong tries\" and \"things I tried specifically to see if they would work and even if they didn't I can analyze why and/or compare them to other things that worked better\".)\n",
    "* The results are explained in conceptual terms, not just a bland report of numbers.\n",
    "* There is a conclusion section that sums up what was found and ideas it generated as to what else could be done in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project may be structured slightly differently (especially if you chose a quite different task, such as generating text rather than predicting something), but the above guidelines are still relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of this project is fairly simple and doesn't do much beyond what we did in the assignments.  This means it would not receive a perfect score on the \"Content\" section of the grading, because (as described in the project guidelines on GauchoSpace) part of what counts there is going beyond what we did in class.  The project does do a few small new things (mostly related to \"discovering\" useful features of pandas and scikit that we didn't discuss in class), but these are more technical in nature and not new ways of applying class concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project would get full points for Code and Explanation though.  It might get, about 25/40 on Content.  In other words, overall this project would be about an A-minus.  It takes an unambitious goal but accomplishes it cleanly.  Part of the point of this example is to say that if you do something very similar to what we did in class, you darn well better do a good job.  If you do something more ambitious, you have more leeway.\n",

    "# Happy Moments\n",
    "## An exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project I decided to work with the [\"HappyDB\" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ritresearch/happydb/home) that I found on Kaggle.  This dataset contains about 100,000 brief descriptions of \"happy moments\", collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Some of the statements have a category label provided and some don't.  The dataset also has demographic information about the people who submitted the happy moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought this would be an interesting data set to explore because it provides a very \"dense\" coverage of a particular kind of emotion.  We discussed sentiment analysis in class, but there we were mostly distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments, or a scale from positive to negative (e.g., star ratings).  But in this case all sentiments are positive.  We can't do sentiment analysis per se with this data because there aren't any sentiment judgments (i.e., no scale or rating distinguishing \"ecstatic moments\" from \"mildly pleasant moments\").  But we can explore the details of the positive side of the sentiment spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main analysis of my project, what I did is I created some scikit models to try to predict the various demographic characteristics based on the text of the happy moment.  Then, I looked at the model coefficients and compared them to see what each word's effectiveness was at predicting each characteristic.  Before getting to that, though, I'll give a brief introduction to the dataset.\n",

It looks like the `age` column was just something where people typed in whatever they wanted, so in addition to regular numbers it contains odd formats like `\"60yrs\"`.  After playing around a bit I was able to convert these to numbers by stripping out all non-numeric characters, and filling in \"NA\" if there was nothing left (which happened when someone put in something like \"prefer not to say\" for their age).  Also there apparently were a couple jokers who put in their age as 2 or 233 or something, so I converted those to NA as well.\n",

Since my project wasn't focused on trying to get the best possible predictions, I didn't spend a lot of time trying to optimize this.  I did wind up using two tweaks: `max_df` sets the maximum document frequency; setting it to a fraction of 0.9 means it will throw out any features that occur in more than 90% of documents.  `min_df` sets the minimum document frequency; setting it to a whole number of 5 means it will throw out any features that occur in fewer than 5 documents.  Using `max_df` also sort of substitutes for using stop words, since any words that occur in almost all the texts will be thrown out.  Because of this, I didn't include the `stop_words` parameter."

    "Many of the words with negative coefficients are related to college life (\"university\", \"exam\", \"professor\", etc.).  This makes sense because, in this data set, the youngest people were around college age (17 or so), so many of their happy moments might be connected with their college experiences.  We also see some more references to girlfriends and boyfriends, which are the types of relationships people are more likely to talk about when they're younger.\n",

    "The words with high coefficients are quite fascinating.  The highest scores come from words referring not just to children but to grandchildren!  I hadn't expected that but it makes total sense, since someone who is happy about something related to grandchildren is probably old enough to have grandchildren.  Words related to children also have positive scores here.  One weird thing is that \"00\", which isn't even a real word, has a really high score.  I'm not sure why that might be.  Old people paying more attention to what time it is?\n",

    "The above scatter plot shows the Married coefficient and the Parent coefficient.  Most of the coefficients are relatively small (between -1 and 1), but they form a large blob that has a clear angle, meaning that even within this group of fairly weak word associations, Married and Parent are associated with the same words.  There are sparse tails of words with very high or low coefficients, which correspond to the words we looked at above (\"son\", \"wife\", etc.).  In the above analysis, I only looked at the top few most strongly associated words for each demographic characteristic.  Looking at this plot is helpful because it confirms that the correlation between these two characteristics is not just apparent for words at the top end, but for the main bulk of words as well.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an interesting project.  Since the text here was brief descriptions of things that made people happy, and I looked at what words were associated with different demographic characteristics, I sort of got a sense of what makes different kinds of people happy.  In particular, kids, spouses, and other relationships seem to be frequent topics of happiness.  I can't really tell if these things make people happy, because all I was looking at here was whether these things predict the demographic characteristics, not the other way around.  So I can't tell if having kids makes people happier; all I can tell is that if people talk about being happy about their kids, they probably have kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems kind of obvious, of course.  But maybe with other data I could take this a step further.  For instance, if I had a dataset where people were just talking about events in their lives (like maybe tweets), it would be interesting to see if mentions of these things were more likely to be positive.  Like maybe if someone posts or tweets about their kids or grandkids, it's more likely to be a positive tweet than a negative one.  That would be an interesting project for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also had some idea about the \"reflection period\" dimension.  One thing that would be interesting is to see if the types of happy events that people thought of were different for the long and short reflection periods.  I saw a little of this in that words like \"dinner\" appeared with negative coefficients, meaning if someone mentioned \"dinner\" that was more likely to be a recent happy moment.  It seems like, in general, if someone asked you for a happy moment in the past three months, you might try to think of something larger-scale, like a job promotion, a vacation, or whatever, rather than something small like a nice dinner or a party you went to.  This could be a window into a different kind of sentiment analysis, where you could try to separate \"small\"  or \"transitory\" happy moments (minor things like a nice dinner) from \"big\" or \"important\" happy moments (like a vacation, a pay raise, a new baby being born, etc.).  I might be able to use the category information to get at this, because it does include separate categories for things like \"achievement\", which I'd imagine are more major happy moments, vs. \"enjoy the moment\" or \"leisure\" which maybe would be smaller-scale moments of happiness.  I might need more data though because only a small proportion of the data points had category information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of project could also be useful in an applied context.  As an example, suppose I worked for a company like Amazon that has lots of product reviews.  If I saw that people gave lots of 5-star reviews and mentioned things like \"my son\" or \"my daughter\" in the review, I could perhaps infer that the people buying the product were older, or that the product was a good gift for kids.  Or, on a more basic level, it could just let me know that this particular consumer has kids and likes to buy things for them.  This could help in recommending products, because you'd know not just to recommend things that the person themselves might want, but things that their kids might want.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of aspects of this project might generalize to other kinds of data.  For instance, knowing these words predict things like age and marital status, you might be able to take these models and predict the age and marital status of people even based on other text, like Yelp reviews or Amazon reviews.  That could be useful demographic information when targeted ads or the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that maybe makes the coefficients not as meaningful, though, is that the models were only medium good.  These coefficients were the model's judgement of how much a given word affected the decision of whether someone was married, a parent, etc.  But the model's accuracy was far from perfect, so looking at how it makes its judgements may not be super informative.  It's like, if someone takes a math quiz and gets 75% correct, that's maybe not the person you want to ask to explain how he got his answers.  Similarly, asking a mediocre model how it made its decisions may not tell us that much.  But the models were a good deal better than random chance, so their coefficients probably do contain some useful information.  It would be interesting to spend a bit more time trying to improve the models' accuracy, and then see if that makes the coefficients even more enlightening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this was a fun project and a good way to practice with scikit, as well as exploring the interpretation of the model coefficients in a more subjective way."
