# Wine Classification

This project was used for my final project in my advanced computational linguistics class where I used some methods of exploratory analysis such as topic modeling and then tested out numerous machine learning algorithms and methods to find the most accurate model. Eventually, I got an A in this class! All of the information can be found in the jupyter notebook.
